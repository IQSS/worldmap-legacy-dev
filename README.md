# worldmap-legacy-dev

Instructions for installing CGA's [legacy worldmap](https://github.com/cga-harvard/cga-worldmap) on a local machine for development.

These are not general use instructions but meant to get a local machine running via vagrant.  Legacy WorldMap will be phased out by end of 2017 as the underlying geonode version is upgraded.
